## üéÆ About the Project
This project was created during the lecture Multimedia Programming at the LMU. The task was to create a 2D game in Unity.
Our game "Excellence Defenders" was finished within 2 months without any previous Unity experience and therefore still has some potential for improvement.

### Game Concept
In the sprawling metropolis of a dystopian Cyberpunk world, within this oppressive society,
the pursuit of excellence has become a mere illusion, overshadowed by the iron grip of
control of the technical overlords of the TUM. But amidst the neon-lit streets and towering corporate
skyscrapers, a glimmer of hope emerges. Excellence has surfaced and now it‚Äôs on you to
defend it‚Ä¶

### Game Setting
The game can be defined as a 2D sidescroller platformer.
The character runs endlessly and has to avoid obstacles and unlock doors to keep going.
If he takes too long it's game over.
